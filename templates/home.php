                        Code the Change: Queen’s Chapter is a student run club on campus whose mandate is to empower
                        computer scientists and engineers to use their technical skills for social change. We run
                        events that let students program in small groups for non-profit organizations from within
                        the Kingston community. Our goal is to give students the opportunity to learn more about
                        programming and interact with other programmers while making a meaningful contribution to
                        the community. Code the Change: Queen’s Chapter is composed of an executive team who plan,
                        organize,and run code jams every year. At each Code Jam students can sign up in small groups or
                        individually to work on a specific project for a social change organization. The social
                        change organizations involved are generally based in Kingston and are in need of help
                        through either web development or mobile app design. By participating in these code jams
                        not only do you get to improve your technical skills as a programmer, but use these skills
                        for a greater cause.

                            Jam. I appreciate the skills that Code Jam devolops as they can be utilized for future
                            projects and employment. I'm very excited to see how many more non-profit organizations

                            Code the Change's vision of volunteering via coding skills is an ingenious idea.
                            I hope anyone who knows even a little bit of code will help non-profit organizations
                            keep up with the changing technology and help those in need.</p>

                            and communications. I like data, reading the news, and computers. I also love the
                            saturation of curious and talented people in the Queen's community who believe
                            in civic betterment. To me, Code the Change is a great connector to bring these
                            people together and a great avenue for focusing all this cognitive surplus towards
                            a common good.</p>
