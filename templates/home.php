                    Code the Change: Queen’s Chapter is a student run club on campus whose mandate is to empower
                    computer scientists and engineers to use their technical skills for social change. We run
                    events that let students program in small groups for non-profit organizations from within
                    the Kingston community. Our goal is to give students the opportunity to learn more about
                    programming and interact with other programmers while making a meaningful contribution to
                    the community. Code the Change: Queen’s Chapter is composed of an executive team who plan,
                    organize,and run code jams every year. At each Code Jam students can sign up in small groups or
                    individually to work on a specific project for a social change organization. The social
                    change organizations involved are generally based in Kingston and are in need of help
                    through either web development or mobile app design. By participating in these code jams
                    not only do you get to improve your technical skills as a programmer, but use these skills
                    for a greater cause.

                            for the benefit of others. This is exactly what Code the Change does during the Code
                            Jam. I appreciate the skills that Code Jam devolops as they can be utilized for future
                            projects and employment. I'm very excited to see how many more non-profit organizations
                            we are able to help this year!</p>

                            I hope anyone who knows even a little bit of code will help non-profit organizations

                            saturation of curious and talented people in the Queen's community who believe
                            in civic betterment. To me, Code the Change is a great connector to bring these
                            people together and a great avenue for focusing all this cognitive surplus towards
                            a common good.</p>

                    <p>Code The Change Queens hosts an annual Code Jam event, where students come together to use their programming and design skills to produce valuable digital tools and resources for non-profit organizations (NPO). Each group of students is led by “Project Manager” that has been paired with a specific NPO meaning the “Project Manager” has an in-depth understanding of the NPOs needs and can ensure that the tool is built to meet them. </p>
               
                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <p>The tools and resources created during the Code Jam help drive NPO’s day to day operations and enable them to grow to serve the community better. Students that participate in the Code Jam utilize their programing and developer skills to solve real world problems while working in a team atmosphere.</p>
					
					<h2>Where?</h2>
                    <p>The Code Jam is an annual twelve hour event during February or January, and is hosted at a venue on Queens Universities Campus in Kingston Ontario.</p>
